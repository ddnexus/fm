This is the docker session home dir.

It contains the dot-files that will
be persisted between sessions.

Press ctrl-h in FM in order to toggle
the visibility of hidden files.

If you mess things up while experimenting,
you can reset this dir by exiting the
docker session and running '~/try-fm reset'
in your terminal: the next start will
reinstall HOME and plugins.
